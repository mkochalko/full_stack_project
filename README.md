### Features

The home page immidiately shows one of the main features of the app which is searching for future available flights. This allows you to select your departure airport(currently only compatiable with correct airport codes) and destination airport along with the departure date and number of passengers.

On submit you will be taken to the flights search page witch shows the index of available flights, the departure times, duration and flight price. Once development is complete a user will be albe to select a flight and proceed to the trip bookings page to 'purchase' and save flights to the users profile.

As trips are booked and trips are taken, all upcoming and past trips will be saved on the users profile page. A user will be able cycle through the upcoming trips for the pertinent information as well as the past trips to track where they have gone.

As mentioned above, once development is complete, users will be able to book trips, which update in the user profile, edit trips, and 'purchase' flights directly on the site. This will allow for a complete flight/trip creation as one would expect on a normal airlines web application.
